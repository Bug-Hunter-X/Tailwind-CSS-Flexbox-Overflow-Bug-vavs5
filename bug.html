This code snippet uses Tailwind's `flex` utility class to create a horizontal layout. However, if the content within either div causes it to overflow, the layout can break unexpectedly, creating unwanted spacing or overlapping elements.  This is because `flex` items by default only take up as much space as their content requires.
